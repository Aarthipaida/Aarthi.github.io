        DATA PROTECTION IN CLOUD ENVIRONMNETS</i> </p></b>
        <p>Our project is to Secure data storage and sharing techniques 
            in cloud environment by using Advanced Encryption 
            Standard algorithm.AES is used to store large amount of data securely.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure represents a sharing environment where the data owners need to share the&nbsp; 
        organization’s valuable data to the cloud platform due to the limited storage and computational &nbsp;
        capacity of the enterprises and the multiple benefits of clouds". Furthermore, the cloud data is &nbsp;
        shared with multiple users as per different requirements for its utility purpose. However, &nbsp;
        the recipient party may leak the data after obtaining it. The data can be leaked by the involved &nbsp;
        parties or may steal by the unauthorized party through illegal access. Data leakage or &nbsp;
        loss may induce a severe threat to the organization’s confidentiality.</p></font>

        <ul>
            <li>It takes less processing time </li>
